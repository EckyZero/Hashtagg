Now, I don't wish to be misunderstood; the world as well as the Art World itself owe a lot to Leonardo da Vinci and Michellangelo (to Brunelleschi as well for the firts glance into perspective on a two-dimensional surface), they were incredibly talented and intelligent BUT how do we compare Artists and their artworks of the 14th century to Artists amd artworks of the 21st century? The world has changed, lifestyle has changed, new technologies become available all the time... Everything indeed has changed from 1400 until 2015. How do we expect then from artists to be still stuck centuries ago and keep producing artworks in the same style? First of all, Artists of the Renaissance had patrons, which means that all their expences for their materials where covered before they even had to start painting and they knew beforehand that their art will be sold, in contrast to today Artists who have to first make their art and then hope that it will sell. Also, how do people like Mr. Robert Florczak ignore the fast pace of today's society? Artists have to study for a degree, which they later have to repay, they have to pay rent, and work to be able to afford art supplies and food; how do anyone expects from an artist to spend as much time as Da Vinci spent on his painting of Mona Lisa? The only way that Art will keep existing is if it keeps evolving, and adjusting to the world TODAY, not to the world that used to be YESTRDAY. But most importantly, we should accept that there are many different styles of Art today and it is true that it is impossible for everyone to like the same thing, but just because an eye doctor cannot give you a heart surgery does not mean that he is useless; it means that you should be looking for what you need.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2015-08-24T11:48:50+0000\",\"like_count\":17,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"927804983929025_928557170520473\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Caleb Smiler\",\"id\":\"10206348041212713\"},\"message\":\"art is political. ring up an illustrator if you want to look at something beautiful\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2015-08-20T23:32:04+0000\",\"like_count\":17,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"927804983929025_930675746975282\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Lindy McKay\",\"id\":\"10154223879755656\"},\"message\":\"I'm an art history graduate, and I think the first part of his video was incomplete.

The splashed ink paintings of Chan Buddhist monks of the Song Dynasty- gestural works in ink on paper most akin to Pollock's paintings--precede that artist by 900 years!\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2015-08-26T00:20:12+0000\",\"like_count\":8,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"927804983929025_929821057060751\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"David Gordon Hill\",\"id\":\"10153094364783302\"},\"message\":\"the majority of modern art isn't about the art its about the bollocks the artist talks about their \\\"art works\\\"\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2015-08-23T19:50:28+0000\",\"like_count\":6,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"927804983929025_931891300187060\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Patrick Girgen\",\"id\":\"10204734627261693\"},\"message\":\"Mr. Florczak\\u2019s argument is anything but objective. There has always been poorly executed art. For each name mentioned as a virtuoso of their generation, there were thousands of hacks. And the term \\\"modern art\\\" does not refer to today, except to those with no art education. It was a movement that ended decades ago. And oddly, it's the old, conservative, art establishment that still thinks a pooping dog is somehow thought provoking and somehow modern. When Duchamp exhibited the \\\"Fountain\\\" in 1917, it did demand that the viewer consider if a porcelain urinal can be considered an artistic expression. But once done, to repeat this (and it does get repeated constantly to this day) is at best banal.\\n\\nArt that is frequently (and incorrectly) grouped together as \\\"classic art\\\" did share a tendency to rarely touch upon controversial ideas and politics. Jacques-Louis David's Death of Marat, shown in the video, is presented as an example of classic artistic statement. Although depicting the assassination of Marat, it places no direct call to action. By today\\u2019s standards it\\u2019s no more controversial than a 6:00 traffic report.\\n\\nAn extremely important point not mentioned in the video is the emergence of perhaps the greatest catalyst of the change in the direction of art; the invention of photography. Prior to photography, photo realism was one of art's greatest goals. But when this mechanical device emerged as a greater depicter of factual reality (mid-1800\\u2019s) than traditional mediums, the art world began to reevaluate its place in our world.\\n\\nAnother important point is the emergence of the middle class and the fall of European aristocracy, which also occurred at about the same time (mid-1800\\u2019s). This eliminated aristocratic patronage on which artists had survived on for centuries. Suddenly there were salons and galleries (and photo studios) to fill the void. And along with this societal shift came an accelerated shift in styles and trends, which the art world both followed and pushed.\\n\\nIt is no coincidence that impressionism emerged soon after. It was at this time that the art world began walking down the road toward abstraction.\\n\\nI found the Jackson Pollock example particularly interesting. My first thought upon seeing the JP image was \\u201cThat does not look like a Jackson Pollock\\u201d. So I question Mr. Florczak\\u2019s assertion that he has fooled classes of highly educated grad students. He is \\u201cfaculty\\u201d at Prager University, which has no arts program, and whose website states in fine-ish print \\u201cPrager University is not an accredited academic institution and does not offer certifications or diplomas.\\u201d\\n\\nMonet, Renoir, Degas, and their contemporaries started us down a road of ever increasing abstraction. This road lasted about 75 years. Along this road we had Van Gogh\\u2019s Starry Night; 1889, Picasso\\u2019s Les Demoiselles d'Avigno; 1907, Matisse\\u2019s The Dance; 1909, Kandinsky\\u2019s Circles in a Circle; 1923, Joan Mir\\u00f3\\u2019s Maternity; 1924, Mondrian\\u2019s Composition II in Red, Blue, and Yellow; 1930, and Klee\\u2019s Zeichen in Gelb; 1937. Each artist claimed to be more abstract than the last. This continued\\u2026 until Jackson Pollock, who in 1947 gave us Full Fathom Five. He placed a giant exclamation point at the end of the road towards abstract expressionism. No one since has successfully argued that their work was more abstract. This makes him one of the most significant figures in art history. Do I respect his contributions? Definitely. Do I like spending time looking at his canvases? Meh, they\\u2019re ok. But the value of his work, and the work of many others; Warhol, Lichtenstein, Herring, Duchamp, Man Ray, Oldenburg, and countless others, is not simply in the aesthetics, but in the ideas.\\n\\nWhat we have inherited from this continual redefining of the definition of art is a far broader idea of what art is. Is it a pretty picture? Sure. Is it a thought provoking statement? Yup. Does it have to be pretty? Does it have to be thought provoking? If so, who gets to be the thought police?\\n\\nThere will always be bad art. There will always be controversial art. Controversial art makes for good press. Unfortunately there is no correlation between good and bad art when it comes to controversy and press. Marcel Walldorf\\u2019s Petra is garbage. Serrano\\u2019 Piss Christ, on the other hand, is quite lovely. And both have gotten a lot of press and both have pissed a lot of people off (pun intended). But to actively try to teach our children what is acceptable art, and what is degenerate art, well, we know how that went last time.\\n\\nSometimes art is about the genius of turning what was considered a ruined piece of stone into Michelangelo\\u2019s David. Sometimes it\\u2019s about the sheer awesomeness of moving a 340 ton rock (approx. 6000 Paris Hiltons) 75 miles at 5 mph through Los Angeles and then dangling it precariously overhead.\\n\\nArt has become more than an aesthetic exercise. Warhol taught us that it had to, because in our modern times a room full of commercial artists (The Factory) can out-product anyone with a brush and an easel.\\n\\nBut do not think for a moment that we do not have virtuoso visual artists today. Mark Ryden, Lori Earley, Greg Simkins, Martin Wittfooth, Olafur Eliasson, and countless others are doing breathtakingly beautiful work.\\n\\nSo Mr. Florczak, I looked at your work on your web site. You\\u2019re a reasonably decent illustrator. The illustration of the photo of Jimmy Stewart wasn\\u2019t bad. If you spent a bit more time practicing, and maybe a bit less time singing, watching movies, and criticizing other people\\u2019s work, you may someday find yourself nearly as good as Thomas Kinkade.\",\"can_remove\":false,\"created_time\":\"2015-08-28T02:53:24+0000\",\"like_count\":5,\"user_likes\":false},{\"id\":\"927804983929025_929449153764608\",\"from\":{\"name\":\"Steve Richardson\",\"id\":\"10205778338311360\"},\"message\":\"The worst modern art gets the headlines but the fact is art is as good or better than it ever has been with extremely broad diversity and unlike during the renaissance when everyone had basically the same style, everyone has their own unique style today including artists who's work looks a lot like art from the renaissance.

I agree that today's bad practice at art schools ist to teach the beginner students right away abstract or even conceptual art. They do not know how to draw!!! Composition? Technologie of art? And they then come, walk barefoot on a canvas and explain that as an 'expression of love for a dance'. On the other side, having learnt the most classical painting as I was a student, I myself built a path to making modern art, from my own feelings. Writing down ideas, reading philosophy, history of art again, etc. So, my collages and installations have an evolution  from the classical - I do not want to cut the thread.  I think that's very important. And iin this video I do not find appropriate criticizing the modern art from it's beginning, because one thing is the middle of the XIX century, when the paintings still serve as a sort of camera, depicting what we see. The end of the century and the whole XX century developes new theories and new perceptions on art. So, it's true that everyone has a right to criticise, the professional criticizing should not resemble to 'women fashion since XIX century is provocative and decadent', ,for example. It should be open minded. Because figurative and realistic way of painting will never cease to be! It was never put away! And I respect both classical and modern art.
